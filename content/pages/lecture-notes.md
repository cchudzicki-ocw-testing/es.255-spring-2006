SUMMARY

1

Introduction yahzzzz

Discussion: Might the natural frequencies of karabiner gates and ropes match under certain circumstances that would cause the karabiner gate to be open during fall arrest?

Three student projects defined:

\- Measurement of karabiner gate opening due to oscillation, both in-vitro (say glued to a speaker cone) and in-vivo (in a drop test).                                    
\- Modeling of the frequency matching between rope and karabiner gate oscillation.                                    
\- Rope middle marking.

 

6

Measured the frequency of rope oscillation.

Measured the spring constant of a karabiner and came up with an estimate for the oscillation frequency of the gate (~25 Hz).

Marked nylon and tried to see if any changes were observable under a light microscope ~100x magnification. No changes were readily apparent.
